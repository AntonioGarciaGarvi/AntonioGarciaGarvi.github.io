excerpt: 'In this article, a novel method for predicting C. elegans poses in cases of multi-worm aggregation and aggregation with noise is proposed. To solve this problem we use an improved U-Net model capable of obtaining images of the next aggregated worm posture. This neural network model was trained/validated using a custom-generated dataset with a synthetic image simulator. Subsequently, tested with a dataset of real images. The results obtained were greater than 75% in precision and 0.65 with Intersection over Union (IoU) values.'
