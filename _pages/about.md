I am an engineer in industrial electronics and automation, especially interested in automation, robotics and programming. 
Within these fields I am especially passionate about Computer Vision.
I am currently working as a researcher developing my doctoral thesis on the automation of experiments with C. elegans nematodes using computer vision techniques. Specifically, I am developing algorithms for detection, segmentation and classification of these nematodes using deep learning techniques and proposing new strategies to train these models in the absence of large amounts of data.
