I am an engineer in Industrial Electronics and Automation, especially passionate about Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
I am currently working as a researcher in the [Automatics and Industrial Informatics Research Institute (ai2)](https://www.ai2.upv.es/en/home-english/) from the [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Valencia (UPV)](http://www.upv.es/en) developing my doctoral thesis on the automation of experiments with *C. elegans* nematodes using computer vision techniques. Specifically, I am developing algorithms for detection, segmentation and classification of these nematodes using deep learning models and proposing new strategies to train these models in the absence of large amounts of data.
