I am an engineer in Industrial Electronics and Automation, with a particular passion for Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
Currently, I work as a researcher at the [Automatics and Industrial Informatics Research Institute (ai2)](https://www.ai2.upv.es/en/home-english/) of the [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Valencia (UPV)](http://www.upv.es/en) , where I am pursuing my doctoral thesis on automating experiments with *C. elegans* nematodes using computer vision techniques. Specifically, my work involves developing algorithms for the detection, segmentation, and classification of these nematodes using deep learning models. Additionally, I am proposing strategies to train these models in situations where large amounts of data are unavailable.
